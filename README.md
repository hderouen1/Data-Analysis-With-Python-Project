# Lending Club Dataset Analysis - NYCDSA Bootcamp Project

## Author: Hunter DeRouen

### Overview
This project is part of the first milestone in the **NYC Data Science Academy (NYCDSA) Bootcamp**. The goal of this analysis is to uncover key insights from the Lending Club dataset, focusing on various borrower characteristics and their impact on loan repayment, default rates, and investor returns. Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows individuals to lend money directly to other individuals.

In this project, we analyze several important factors such as **loan grades, employment history, homeownership, geographic distribution**, and **creditworthiness** to better understand loan behavior and provide actionable insights for investors.

### Dataset
The dataset includes comprehensive information on borrowers, loan amounts, loan terms, interest rates, borrower credit profiles, and repayment status. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we highlight key trends and patterns in borrower behavior and loan outcomes.

## Key Data Insights

### 1. **Interest Rates and Loan Grades**
- **Insight**: Interest rates vary significantly according to the loan grade, which represents the creditworthiness of the borrower.
  - Borrowers with **higher loan grades (A, B)** receive **lower interest rates**, indicating lower credit risk.
  - Borrowers with **lower loan grades (D, E, F, G)** are assigned **higher interest rates**, reflecting higher risk due to potential credit issues.
  - **Outliers** exist, where some high-risk borrowers still receive lower interest rates, warranting further investigation into these anomalies.

### 2. **Employment History and Loan Repayment**
- **Insight**: Borrowers with **shorter employment histories (less than 5 years)** tend to have more difficulties in repaying loans. 
  - The analysis shows a lower incidence of **early loan repayment** among borrowers with shorter employment histories.
  - **Interest Accrual**: Borrowers with shorter employment durations provide an opportunity for lenders to earn more interest over the full loan term as they are less likely to repay early.

### 3. **Home Ownership and Default Rates**
- **Insight**: Borrowers' homeownership status affects default and charged-off rates.
  - **Homeowners** (including those with mortgages) have a **charged-off rate of 10-12%**, indicating a lower likelihood of default.
  - **Renters**, on the other hand, exhibit a higher charged-off rate of **13.86%**. This suggests that **homeowners** are generally more reliable when it comes to loan repayment compared to renters.
  
### 4. **Geographic Distribution and Loan Amounts**
- **Insight**: The **average loan amount** varies by state, with some states showing higher average loan amounts than others.
  - Borrowers in certain states tend to take out **larger loans**, which may lead to **higher default rates** and increased interest accrual over time.
  - **Geographic and economic conditions**, such as local living costs and employment rates, influence borrowing behavior and loan size.

### 5. **Creditworthiness and FICO Scores**
- **Insight**: There is a strong correlation between borrower **FICO scores** and their loan repayment behavior.
  - Borrowers with **higher FICO scores** are more likely to **repay loans early**, reducing the long-term interest that investors can earn.
  - Investors should carefully consider FICO scores when making lending decisions to balance the trade-off between **lower risk** and **maximizing interest returns**.

### 6. **Geographic Risks and Default Rates**
- **Insight**: Certain regions or states exhibit **higher loan default rates** due to factors like unemployment rates, regional economic health, and other financial stressors.
  - States with **higher total loan balances** and **lower annual incomes** are more likely to have borrowers who default or become delinquent.
  - Investors should take into account the **financial health** of different states and the **income-to-debt ratio** of borrowers to mitigate geographic risks when allocating loans.

## Summary of Findings
- **High-grade borrowers (A, B)** offer lower interest rates but represent a lower risk to investors.
- Borrowers with **shorter employment histories** and **renters** provide a higher opportunity for long-term interest accrual but also carry a higher risk of default.
- **Homeownership** is a good indicator of a borrower's likelihood of repaying loans, with homeowners showing lower default rates than renters.
- **Geographic factors** play an important role in loan size and repayment behaviors, with certain states posing higher risks than others.
- **Credit scores (FICO)** and **financial health indicators** should be a primary focus when assessing the risk level of borrowers.

## Recommendations for Investors
1. **Analyze Loan Grades**: Focus on borrowers with mid-to-high grades (A, B, and C) for lower risk while balancing with higher-grade borrowers (D, E) if looking to maximize interest returns.
2. **Employment and Homeownership Status**: Prioritize borrowers with longer employment histories and homeownership to minimize the risk of default.
3. **Geographic Consideration**: Evaluate borrowers based on their state of residence, as certain regions may show higher default rates due to local economic conditions.
4. **Credit Scores**: Use borrower **FICO scores** as a primary metric for determining creditworthiness and the likelihood of early repayment.
5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread loan allocations across different states and borrower profiles to mitigate risk while maximizing returns.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Modeling**: Future work could include building predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to forecast the likelihood of default based on borrower characteristics.
- **Loan Performance Metrics**: Deeper analysis of loan performance metrics and the relationship between borrower behavior and investor returns could provide further insights into optimizing lending strategies.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and wrangling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploring patterns.
- **Scikit-learn**: For potential future predictive modeling (if applicable).
